# File List

The UI includes a file and directory browser that allows you to view file contents in these locations:

- default workspace
- external workspaces
- bazel-bin 
- bazel-genfiles
- bazel-testlogs

Exploring files can be useful because it tends to be more opaque to users.

Build outputs in various points in the UI are linked to the file list, allowing you to inspect generated files more easily.

Look for the **[Files]** button:

Which yields:

<img width="720" alt="https://github.com/bzl-io/bzl/pull/12" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50580/106346557-44ce5280-6275-11eb-8071-3aab84bee527.png" style="border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.16)">

Navigate to the file of interest:
