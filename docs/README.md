# Docs

This folder contains our Jekyll based docs site which is hosted at
https://docs.bzl.io/bzl.

When making changes to this docs site, please test your changes locally:

```bash
docs$ make serve
```

To run the docs site locally you will need Ruby at version 2.5.0 or
higher and `bundle` (`gem install bundler` if you already have Ruby).
